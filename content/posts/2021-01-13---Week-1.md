This blog site is primarily created for me to record my thoughts and experiences of becoming a self taught artist, a place to improve my writing ability and to keep me accountable. Outside of the above, I will likely be documenting my fitness routine.

Caught up with one of my friend for a 12km run. Since the beginning of January, my run mileage has considerably dropped. Fingers crossed I get into this years 6-foot track again and back into some sort of routine.

The motivation to start drawing wasn't there today and instead worked on personalisng my blog. I thought about how I would structure my art diary and much of it is based on LEEPIX_X and Zettelkasten method of storing notes. 

Things to improve
- Better placement of Dates.

Today I signed up to Schoolism. It is an online art school with 42 courses to keep me occupied for the year. My plan is to get through all the digital ones and document them here. 
I need a bit of guidance as there are too much information on the internet and it is difficult to know where to start. Limiting myself to Schoolism should help me focus and take things step by step. 

Currently picking out the fundamental course and "Drawing Fundamentals with Thomas Fluharty" will be my first.
